== 3.2.1 ==
- fixed problem with IS_FIXED_SIZE macro for cubic elements
- added check for open file to routines that don't take
  a file number (suggestion from Marc Poinet)
- added HTMLHelp interface to cmake scripts
- added AdditionalFamilyName to UserDefinedData
- fixed compiler complaint about comparison between int and enum
- added routines to set MPI communicator for parallel I/O
- updated CMake scripts to work within other scripts (remove conflicts)
- updates to some cgnstools utility conversion routines
- fixes and updates to tests and cgnscheck
- updates to support CG_FILE_ADF2 (2.5 compatibility)
- fix for point set subregions

== 3.2 ===
- full integration of parallel I/O using HDF5 with MPI
- implemented CPEX 0033 and 0034
- compression (rewriting) of file to remove unused space is no
  longer automatically done, since may interfere with parallel I/O.
  Added cgnscompress program to tools to do this afterwards.
- removed cgnsversion program from tools since support was getting
  out of hand (N squared problem with versions).
- added routines to convert to and from AFLR3, FAST, and TetGen
- implemented cubic elements (CPEX 0036)
- CGNStools documentation no longer included with source.
  The NASA Glenn website (or local copy) is now used instead.

== 3.1.4-2 ==
- fixes to cmake scripts for Fortran
- added check for open file to routines that don't take
  a file number (suggestion from Marc Poinet)
- CGNStools documentation no longer included with source.
  The NASA Glenn website (or local copy) is now used instead.
- save window size for cgnsview
- fix to computing path lists in CMake script

== 3.1.4 ==
- added some const definitions to library
- moved unlink of filename when using CG_MODE_WRITE on open to cgio
- fixed goto for FamilyBCDataset for UserData, .etc
- added cg_get_cgio_f and cg_root_id_f Fortran routines
- fixed cmake and configure scripts to allow MPI with HDF5 and
  fixed bugs in those scripts
- updated CGNSplot to handle all element types and 1-d and 2-d cases
- fixes to cgnscheck
- cleaned up some compiler warnings
- added cgnsBuild.defs Makefile include to installation
- removed unneeded tools directory from cgnstools
- cgnstools no longer built automatically - need to set configure flag
- allow CellCenter for BCs
- added cg_precision and cg_precision_f functions to get integer
  size used to create the file (32 or 64)

== 3.0.8 ==
- Fix flag
- Test for v3.0 release

== 3.0.7 ==
- Internal updates

== 3.0.6 ==
- Internal updates

== 3.0.5 ==
- Added install.txt and install.lyx
- Added readme.txt and readme.lyx
- Re-integrated the automake build system into the src directory
  so that the old build system can be used by invoking ./configure
  make, make install in the src directory.
- Added license.txt

== 3.0.4 ==
- Fixed a compilation problem with gcc-4.1

== 3.0.3
- Internal debugging release

== 3.0.2 ==
- Fixed BUILD_HDF5 flag in CMakeLists.txt
- Fixed file prop list scope problem in ADFH.c
